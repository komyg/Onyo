# Onyo

This project is a proof of concept for Onyo of a frontend to edit a restaurant menu.

Currently the frontend loads the menu data from the Onyo backend and supports removing or adding a product.

### Notes:

*   It is only possible to add a fake product to the restaurant menu. Further development is needed to create a dialog that allows the user to choose an existing product or to create a new one.

*   No data is being persisted in the Onyo backend.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
